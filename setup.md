## setup
this is a 4tb nas but I am hoping to run it using a raid 10 setup, therefore, I need a total of 8tb. hence I will use 4 tb worth of sata ssd (specific model:
 tbd) and have it backed up on a 4tb hdd. decided on this setup to maximize speed of initial transfers (into sata ssds) and still ensure backup through the hdds
 despite potential slow speeds
